            </div>

            <p>My mission in 2022 is to at least complete all the assignments of this course no matter what mistakes I
                make
                or what time it takes. Currently, I have a full-time job, which is a very hectic one (not programming
                job
                though). So, it is really tough for me to manage time for study and practise, moreover, I have been
                dealing
                with some unavoidable family issues, which I
                will continue to have. But,
                I decided to go slow and will be happy as long as I will make progress.
